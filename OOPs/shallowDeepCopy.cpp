// Shallow & Deep Copy
// Shallow copy copies references to original array. But array remains same.

// Deep copy created a brand new copy of the array.

// Compiler generally creates a shallow copy for array.

// We need to define own copy constructor when deep copy is needed i.e. when class contains pointers to dynamically allocatedÂ memory.
